# CART-Algorithm
### What is this?

CART (**C**lassification **A**nd **R**egression **T**rees) is an algorithm that can be used to train Decision trees on various classification and regression tasks. In this case, we had to implement a CART algorithm for assignment in **Big Data Analytics Programming** (BDAP) course at KU Leuven. We had to implement a CART algorithm with support for both numerical and categorical features. The implementation was graded based on correctness, speed, and style. My implementation is trained (on average) on the whole **[Covertype](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype)** dataset in 100 seconds (Weka implementation needs 15 seconds). The algorithm is entirely written in C++.
